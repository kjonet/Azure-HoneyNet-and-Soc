In this lab, we're going generate our own attack traffic from a few vulnerable vm's. Once that traffic is generated, we'll analyze and capture logs. We'll also be defining alerts for malicious activity that will trigger security incidents within Sentinel.  Next, We'll remediate and harden our vm's in accordance with NIST 800-61 standards.
